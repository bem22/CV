## Work Experience
#### Lead R&D Engineer - WeMBED Systems S.R.L - Austria/Germany/The Netherlands July 2020 - Present
 + Drawing on my Computer Science background and self-taught electronics design skills, I founded and managed the company across four key areas:
    - **Research**: Explored leading-edge sensor and embedded CPU technologies and built my familiarity with the ecosystems of Infineon, Nordic, NXP and Texas Instruments, creating efficient and compact devices for streamlined data collection in research applications, which resulted in two patent pending devices.
    - **Development**: Building upon our research, I crafted more than 30 hardware prototypes that yielded five distinct products. These achievements not only facilitated our clients in delivering innovation within the domain of life sciences, but also played a pivotal role in attracting first and second seed of investments.
    - **Production and Manufacturing**: I invested strategically in a dedicated hardware engineering lab and we successfully achieved to bring mid-scale production for our clients. Additionally, through my active participation in international trade fairs such as Embedded World and Electronica I built a network of chip manufacturers and distributors which is backing us with early access for cutting-edge chips, including sensors,  microcontrollers and passive components, at favorable prices. I am in constant collaboration with manufacturers who support us with components while we support them with feedback and suggestions for their documentation and user/developer experience while using their products
    - **Operations**: Leveraging my DevOps know-how, I led the way in crafting custom server architectures for each product launch - this ensured GDPR compliance, data security, and frictionless networking using custom VPNs across institutions, making it easier for our startups to deploy their solutions
 + Led a tight-knit team of four, fostering balanced contributions and individual career progress while promoting a culture of ongoing learning and personal development
 + Managed a range of business administration tasks, encompassing accounting oversight, customer acquisition, and cultivating strategic synergies with other businesses and developers.

#### DevOps Engineer and backend developer - magic42 LTD Birmingham, October 2018 - July 2019
 + Managed a database restructuring project which led to the GDPR compliance of the business
 + Supervised the integration, deployment and downtime prevention on a client's live server for 4 months
 + Delivered security risk assessments that prevented database backdoors on multi-million e-comerce platform
 + Enhanced the code review process productivity for the organization by integrating a notification system for the developers
 + Maintained virtualization software such as Docker and Vagrant
 + I helped the organization's social goals by presenting quarterly fitness workshops on healthy eating and exercising, which positively impacted my colleagues' mood and productivity

#### IT Project Manager - Study Abroad & Exchanges University of Birmingham, Feb 2018 - June 2018
 + Merged two databases to comply with ERASMUS database standards
 + Optimised team's website for search engines and increased number of visits by 19%
 + Improved office's workflow by coaching employees on writing SQL scripts for Excel

## Education 

__BSc Computer Science with a Year in Industry at University of Birmingham - 2016 - 2020__ 
 + The highlight of my degree is [__Project Hawk__](https://github.com/bem22/project-hawk) - I researched, designed and integrated a drone for studying cell tower compatibility for comercial drone applications. From designing the PCB to developing a new blazing fast 4G network engine, this project has become the foundation stone of my career as systems engineer and assured my place in the industry early on - [__See my dissertation__](https://github.com/bem22/project-hawk/blob/master/HAWK_FINAL_PAPER.pdf)
 + 1st class degree, being pasionate about studying Kernel programming, Network and Security, Embedded Software Engineering and Computer Systems & Architecture
 + Besides low level architecture and languages of computer design, the degree exposed me to key concepts and hands-on experience for helping teams and businesses. Knowing how to implement Agile and Waterfall methods in organizations helps me deliver for big budget projects, as well as for fast and nimble startups


__A Level equivalent (Romanian Baccalaureate / High School Level) in Computer Science and Advanced Maths - 2012 - 2016__
 + 91% in C programming 
 + 90% in Advanced Maths
 + C1 English Language proficiency through IELTS (2017)


## Self-taught skills
 + One of the modules in year 2 of University sparked my curiosity into low level computing which led to understanding the CPUs and memory down to logic gate level - I was disatisfied with the price, design inflexibility and quality of PCBs so I started learned how to design my own, having had access to the hardware penetration lab in my faculty, in 2020
 + Working with clients and colleagues has led me to delve deeper into the art of listening without judgment and resolving conflicts and crises without exacerbating stress - this keeps everyone sane, happy and productive
 + I had to learn how to trick my brain into a productivity mindset and deliver more in less time by delegating tasks, restructuring the work pipeline and prioritization (I highly recommend reading "The Goal" by Eliyahu M. Goldratt)

## Languages
* _**English**_ (Fluent), _**French**_ (Intermediate), _**Romanian**_ (Native), _**German**_ (Conversational)

## Hobbies
 * Sports: I am a triathlete and avid cyclist. I also enjoy yoga, pilates and cross training
 * Reading: I enjoy psychology books related to childhood development and deep phylosophical topics such as the nature of the universe
 * 55% of the non tech content I consume online is on cooking so naturally this is a big part of my free time
