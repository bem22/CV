Systems Architecture Hiring Manager,

In my placement, I have always challenged the status quo. From changing the way specification lists were written to having full access on client's live servers for deployment, I had an impact on every step of the software development process.

Two years ago, I was working with my first Arduino Uno making sense of the RISC architecture, and I made a Google search on the topic. The first result that occurred was "ARM" or Advanced RISC Machines. "Advanced?" I asked myself. "But is there a difference between an __Advanced RISC Machine__ and a _standard_ one?". Expectedly, "standard" RISC was merely a _null pointer_, but I discovered something more interesting.  

This was my entry point to ARM, and then I choose to study Computer Systems Architecture, as part of my BSc. Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. As such, I delved deeper into CPU architecture, understanding the differences between ARM, MIPS and x86.

Assembly sparked my interest in low-level programming and inspired me to apply for a role at ARM, and I wish to become a part of the team that changed the world through innovation.

I am looking forward to hearing from you!

Yours faithfully,
Mihai-Emilian Buduroi
