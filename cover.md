Dear Taurob,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Cyber Security Analyst position currently advertised on your website. My name is Mihai-Emilian Buduroi, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and passion for hardware and software security to your team.

I hold a degree in Computer Science (First degree with Hons.), which has provided me with a solid foundation in software engineering and data analysis. However, my journey has taken an exciting turn towards hardware and electronics, driven by my deep-rooted fascination with technology. This transformation in my career direction was catalyzed by my final year project, Project HAWK. This project exposed me to the captivating world of hardware design and low latency network protocols which set me on a path that I have passionately pursued ever since.

For the past three years, I have been self-employed, running my own company dedicated to building smart secure IoT solutions and providing rapid prototyping solutions for startups. This entrepreneurial endeavor has allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in hardware engineering, expand on my software engineering background and deal with real-time product development challenges. I have established a fully equipped lab here in Vienna, where I continually experiment, test hardware and innovate. My dedication to my work is unwavering, and I thrive on the challenges and possibilities that hardware engineering and especially hardware security presents.

One of my recent achievements was leading a significant project for a startup, resulting in a technology that is currently pending patent approval. This accomplishment is a testament to my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and dedication to innovation. Now, I am eager to bring my expertise and passion to a new challenge in Vienna.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my final year project, as well as the various projects I have undertaken for my business and personal interests, such as 3D printing and R&D. I believe that my skills and experiences align well with the goals and values of your organization. I am eager to explore how my contributions can complement your team's efforts and drive innovation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of working with you and discovering the synergies we can create together.

Yours sincerely,

Mihai-Emilian Buduroi
