Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Mihai-Emilian Buduroi, and it is with great enthusiasm that I am applying for Graduate Systems Architecture Engineer 2020 position currently advertised on your website. I am currently in my final working towards a BSc. Computer Science with Industrial Placement at the University of Birmingham, UK.

I am passionate about low-level programming and electronics. ARM's prevalence in the IoT and mobile industry encouraged me to apply to become part of an incredible team that changed the world through innovation. I want to be involved in engineering software for embedded systems, and I believe I could deepen my knowledge by joining ARM.

During my placement, I always challenged the status quo, transforming risk into reward one decision at a time. From improving project specification write-up to having full access on client's live servers for deployment, my team and I made an impact in every step of the software development process. I believe that the diversity of perspectives and the synergy between team members can lead to productive and creative results. For example, in the planning of the biggest project of last year (a RESTful microservice for geolocation), during a brainstorming session, I persuaded two more introverted members to share their ideas with the rest of the group. One of the ideas became part of our strategy for the deployment step of our project.

I like to challenge yesterday's technology, understanding that there's always space for improvement in the design. This is also my focus in my final year project, where I am building a network of drones that can be dispatched worldwide on 4G networks. My project involves designing an efficient network protocol, low-level communication between components and PCB design. I enjoy working on this project and, although electrical engineering is not part of my degree, I thrive, being empowered by my passion.

I am looking forward to hearing from you and the opportunity to discuss my application with you further.

Yours faithfully, 
Mihai-Emilian Buduroi
